# Adaptive Conformal Prediction Analysis

**Project: Adaptive Conformal Prediction Analysis**  
**Authors**: Giuseppina Orefice, Alessandra Campanella  
**Date**: 12 gennaio 2025  

This project implements the AgACI (Adaptive Aggregated Conformal Inference) method, an extension of ACI (Adaptive Conformal Inference) that eliminates the need to manually select the adaptation parameter γ.

AgACI combines multiple ACI experts with different γ_k values, dynamically adapting predictions to ensure robustness against changes in time series data.
